## Example

- ID: BUG-001
- Title: Script fails when class files missing
- Status: resolved
- Reported by: julietfiss
- Date: 2025-10-09
- Environment: macOS, openjdk 11, branch main
- Description: Running `./run-signalshow.sh` failed with "Error: Could not find or load main class SignalShow" when class files were not compiled.
- Steps to reproduce:
  1. Clone repository
  2. Remove `SignalShow/SignalShow.class` if present
  3. Run `./run-signalshow.sh`
- Expected behavior: Script should compile sources and run the application.
- Actual behavior: Java threw ClassNotFoundException because `.class` not present.
- Logs / stacktrace:
  Error: Could not find or load main class SignalShow
  Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: SignalShow
- Temporary workaround: Manually compile with `javac SignalShow.java signals/**/*.java` before running.
- Notes / PR: Updated `run-signalshow.sh` to automatically compile missing classes and committed as "Add automatic compilation to run-signalshow.sh script" (commit b996cd6).
