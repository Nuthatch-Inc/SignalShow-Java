Git Workflow Policy:
- DO NOT automatically commit changes unless the user explicitly asks
- DO NOT automatically push changes unless the user explicitly asks  
- After making code changes, compile and verify, but stop there
- Let the user review changes and decide when to commit/push
- Only run git commands (add, commit, push) when directly requested
