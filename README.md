SignalShow
===========

Overview
--------
SignalShow is a Java-based educational and exploratory signal processing application. It enables creation, visualization, and manipulation of 1窶船 and 2窶船 analytic functions and sampled data, with interactive plots and a library of signal and image processing operations (Fourier transforms, filtering, convolution, hologram demos, etc.). The user interface is implemented with Swing. Source code resides under the `SignalShow/` directory; the entry point is the top-level `SignalShow` class.

Key Features
------------
* Analytic function generators (Gaussian, Chirp, Delta, Bessel, windows, noise models, etc.)
* 1窶船 / 2窶船 interactive plotting (zoom, pan, overlays)
* Frequency-domain and convolution operations
* Educational demos (sampling, filtering, holography, more)
* Modular operation architecture (extend with new function/operation classes)

Project Structure (high level)
------------------------------
```
SignalShow/
  SignalShow.java          # Main entry point (default package)
  jai_core.jar             # JAI core classes (bundled)
  jai_codec.jar            # JAI codec classes (bundled)
  signals/                 # Application packages (core, gui, operations, demos, etc.)
  run-signalshow.sh        # Convenience launcher script
```

Prerequisites
-------------
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later (older versions may also work; modules are not strictly required)
* Bundled Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) jars: `jai_core.jar`, `jai_codec.jar` (already present)

Quick Start
-----------
From the repository root:

```bash
./run-signalshow.sh
```

This script:
1. Verifies required JAI jars exist.
2. Sets the classpath to include `SignalShow/` (compiled classes) and the two JAI jars.
3. Launches the main class `SignalShow`.

Building from Source
--------------------
If you need to (re)compile the Java sources (e.g. after modifications):

```bash
find SignalShow -name "*.java" > /tmp/sigshow-srcs.txt
javac -d . @/tmp/sigshow-srcs.txt
```

Then run:

```bash
java -cp "SignalShow:SignalShow/jai_core.jar:SignalShow/jai_codec.jar" SignalShow
```

Alternatively, a one-liner compile + run:

```bash
find SignalShow -name "*.java" -print0 | xargs -0 javac -d . && \
java -cp "SignalShow:SignalShow/jai_core.jar:SignalShow/jai_codec.jar" SignalShow
```

Troubleshooting
---------------
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| `NoClassDefFoundError: javax/media/jai/PlanarImage` | JAI jars not on classpath or duplicate extracted classes causing conflicts | Ensure classpath includes `SignalShow/jai_core.jar:SignalShow/jai_codec.jar`. Remove any accidentally extracted `SignalShow/javax` directory. |
| `SecurityException: sealing violation: can't seal package javax.media.jai` | Duplicate package definition (e.g. extracted `javax/media/jai` alongside jar) | Delete the stray `javax/` directory so only the jar supplies the package. |
| `UnsatisfiedLinkError` referencing JAI native libs | Platform mismatch (x86 vs arm64) or missing native library | Run under Rosetta with an x86 JDK, or obtain arm64 native builds if available. |

Diagnostics Helpers
-------------------
List any native libraries (none are expected in a clean tree):
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.so" -o -name "*.dylib" -o -name "*.jnilib" -o -name "*.dll" \) -print
```

Check a specific class inside a jar:
```bash
jar tf SignalShow/jai_core.jar | grep javax/media/jai/PlanarImage.class
```

Remove accidentally extracted classes:
```bash
rm -rf SignalShow/javax
```

Extending the Application
-------------------------
New analytic functions or operations can be added by creating additional classes under appropriate `signals/...` subpackages (e.g. function terms or operation implementations) and wiring them into existing registries or menus in the GUI layer.

Developer Notes
---------------
Temporary local debug helper classes (e.g., small loader or reflection test snippets) are intentionally excluded via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean. If you create ad-hoc helper files while experimenting, consider following the existing ignore patterns so they are not committed inadvertently.
